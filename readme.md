My Four Function Calculator
-----------------------------

This simple calculator can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers and
return an answer accurate to 6 decimal places. The design is still in the works
because I am struggling with CSS.

To run simply run (in the terminal):

```
javac MainWindow.java Computer.java
java MainWindow
```
